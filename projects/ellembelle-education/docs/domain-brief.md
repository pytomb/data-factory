# Domain Brief: Ellembelle STEM Tutor

> Generated by Data Factory - Discovery Phase

## Domain Overview

**Domain Name:** Education - STEM Tutoring
**Geographic Focus:** Ellembelle District, Western Region, Ghana
**Target Hardware:** Edge devices (offline-capable, low-memory)

**Description:**
A domain-tuned AI model for STEM education that understands Ghanaian cultural context, local examples, and regional dialects. The model will serve as an AI tutor for students in rural areas where internet connectivity is limited and access to qualified STEM teachers is scarce.

## Target Languages

| Language | Code | Priority | Notes |
|----------|------|----------|-------|
| English (Ghana) | en-gh | Primary | Ghanaian English with local expressions |
| Twi | twi | Secondary | Major Akan language |
| Nzema | nzema | Secondary | Local language of Ellembelle |
| Fante | fante | Tertiary | Coastal Akan dialect |

## Dialects & Variations

### Ghanaian English Markers
- Currency: Cedis (GH₵), Pesewas
- Greetings: "Akwaaba" (welcome), "Medaaase" (thank you)
- Time expressions: "Small small" (gradually), "By all means"
- Local measurements and expressions

### Educational Context
- Ghana Education Service (GES) curriculum alignment
- JHS (Junior High School) and SHS (Senior High School) levels
- WAEC/WASSCE examination preparation
- Local school terminology and practices

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **STEM Tutoring** - Mathematics, Science, ICT explanations using local context
2. **Homework Help** - Step-by-step problem solving with relatable examples
3. **Concept Explanation** - Breaking down complex topics using familiar scenarios
4. **Exam Preparation** - BECE and WASSCE practice with localized content

### Secondary Use Cases
1. **Agricultural Science** - Crop yields, farming calculations (cocoa, palm, cassava)
2. **Financial Literacy** - Market math, profit/loss with local currencies
3. **Health Education** - CHPS compound references, local health context
4. **Environmental Science** - Local ecosystems, coastal geography

## Knowledge Requirements

### Core Knowledge Areas
- **Mathematics**: Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Statistics (JHS-SHS level)
- **Science**: Biology, Chemistry, Physics (integrated science)
- **ICT**: Basic computing, digital literacy
- **Agricultural Science**: Crop cultivation, animal husbandry (Ghana context)

### Domain-Specific Vocabulary

| Term | Definition | Context |
|------|------------|---------|
| Cedis | Ghanaian currency (GH₵) | Financial calculations |
| Pesewas | Cedis subunit (100 pesewas = 1 cedi) | Small transactions |
| JHS | Junior High School | Education level |
| SHS | Senior High School | Education level |
| BECE | Basic Education Certificate Exam | JHS completion |
| WASSCE | West African Senior School Certificate Exam | SHS completion |
| CHPS | Community-based Health Planning and Services | Healthcare context |
| Agbogbloshie | Large market in Accra | Market examples |

### Cultural Context Requirements
- **Markets and Trading**: Makola, Kejetia, local markets for math problems
- **Agriculture**: Cocoa farming, fishing, palm oil for applied science
- **Geography**: Coastal features, Volta Lake, local landmarks
- **Social Context**: Community structures, family dynamics
- **Religion/Values**: Respectful tone, community-oriented examples

## Success Criteria

### Model Must:
- [x] Use Ghanaian English appropriately (cedis, local expressions)
- [x] Provide step-by-step explanations suitable for self-study
- [x] Align with Ghana Education Service curriculum
- [x] Run efficiently on edge hardware (4GB RAM, CPU-only)
- [x] Generate accurate STEM content (90%+ factual accuracy)

### Model Should:
- [ ] Incorporate local examples (yam sales, cocoa prices, fishing)
- [ ] Support code-switching with Twi/Nzema phrases
- [ ] Recognize and respond to local greetings
- [ ] Provide culturally appropriate encouragement

### Model Should NOT:
- [ ] Use Western-centric examples (dollars, unfamiliar sports)
- [ ] Assume constant internet connectivity
- [ ] Require more than 4GB memory for inference
- [ ] Provide answers without explanation
- [ ] Use condescending or culturally insensitive language

## Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibility | Approval Required |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Domain Expert | STEM content validation, curriculum alignment | Yes |
| Language Expert | Dialect accuracy, cultural appropriateness | Yes |
| Ethics Reviewer | Data governance, consent, community impact | Yes |
| ML Engineer | Model training, quantization, edge deployment | Yes |
| Education Specialist | Pedagogical effectiveness | Yes |

## Integration with MVP Factory

Upon completion, this model will be handed off to MVP Factory for:
1. **Teacher Dashboard** - Classroom management, student progress
2. **Student App** - Mobile-first tutoring interface
3. **Offline Sync** - Content caching for intermittent connectivity
4. **Assessment Tools** - Practice problems and progress tracking

## Base Model Selection

**Recommended:** google/gemma-2b-it
- Size: 2B parameters (edge-friendly)
- Instruction-tuned (suitable for tutoring)
- Apache 2.0 license (commercial use OK)
- Good baseline for domain adaptation

**Alternatives:**
- meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat (larger, better quality, but heavier)
- microsoft/phi-2 (smaller, but less tested for education)
